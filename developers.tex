\subsection{main.c} \label{ssec:p0main}
This file contains the entry point of the compiler.
It passes the arguments from the command line to a method that parses them (described in section \ref{ssec:p0argparser}) and returns a \code{struct} that contains info about what flags were passed and what the possible output file might be (should that have been given).
I then check which flag got passed in and whether the output should be written to a provided file or just \code{stdout}.
The only \code{mode} flag that currently gets handled is \code{-0}.

\subsection{args\_parser} \label{ssec:p0argparser}
The header file contains a \code{struct}, an \code{enum} (both described in section \ref{ssec:p0datastructs}), and a method signature that gets implemented in \code{args\_parser.c}.
Here I use \code{getopt} from \code{unistd.h} to read/parse each flag and then record which flag and whether there was an output file to a \code{struct} that I return.
The potential output file gets passed back as an out-parameter.
If no flags were passed in, or one that doesn't exist, I print out the string that describes how to use the program to \code{stderr}.

\subsection{Data Structures} \label{ssec:p0datastructs}
There is one \code{struct} and one \code{enum} that have been defined so far:
\begin{itemize}
    \item (\code{struct}) \code{parsed\_args\_t}: This data type holds what \code{mode} flag gets passed in by way of the \code{mode\_e enum}.
    It also contains a flag that signals if there is a specific output file that should be written to instead of \code{stdout}.
    \item (\code{enum}) \code{mode\_e}: This just represents the possible \code{mode} flags that can be passed in plus an extra one that is set by default to make it easier to check if none of the required flags were passed in.
\end{itemize}
